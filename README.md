Project Name: Bailando 
Overview
This project involves generating dancing results using the VQ-VAE model. The setup includes creating a suitable environment, installing dependencies, and executing scripts for evaluation. The results of experiments are available for review in the experiments folder.

Requirements
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) installed and configured.
Python (preferably a version compatible with the listed dependencies).
Git for cloning the repository.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository

Running the Evaluation
Generating Dancing Results
To test the VQ-VAE model with or without global shift, as specified in the configuration file, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
sh srun.sh configs/sep_vqvae.yaml eval [your node name] 1
Replace [your node name] with the appropriate node name you are using.

Experiment Results
